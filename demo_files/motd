Welcome to the DoppioJVM demo!

This demo comes packed with a number of JVM languages (Scala, Groovy, Scheme),
some basic programs and utilities (javac, accounting software), and standard
shell commands that interact with our in-browser filesystem!

For example, try a simple Fibonacci demo:    java classes/demo/Fib <num>

Then, edit the demo, recompile it, and run the new version:

  edit classes/demo/Fib.java
  javac classes/demo/Fib.java
  java classes/demo/Fib

Hop into Clojure's repl with the `clojure` command. Or try `nashorn`, a
repl for JavaScript running on the JVM!

Type `help` for more information, or `tip` for an idea. Ctrl+C is SIGINT.
Tab-completion and globbing should mimic commonly used bash features.

DoppioJVM has been tested with the latest versions of most popular browsers,
but if you find a bug or have a question, let us know on Github at:
