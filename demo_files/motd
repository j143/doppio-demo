Welcome to DoppioJVM! You may wish to try the following Java programs:

  java classes/demo/Fib <num>
  java classes/demo/Chatterbot
  java classes/demo/RegexTestHarness

Text files can be created/modified with the `edit` command, or
imported using the "upload" button above the console.
Try making a file, then running the following programs:

  java classes/demo/GzipDemo c Hello.txt hello.gz  # compress your text file
  java classes/demo/GzipDemo d hello.gz hello.tmp  # decompress it
  java classes/demo/DiffPrint Hello.txt hello.tmp  # compare with original

Next, try compiling a Java program with `javac`:

  javac classes/demo/Fib.java

We can even run `rhino`, the Java-based JavaScript engine!

`help` prints a full list of commands. Ctrl+D is EOF. Ctrl+C is SIGINT.
Tab-completion and globbing should mimic commonly used bash features.

DoppioJVM has been tested with the latest versions of most popular browsers,
